# TIP: Toxicology Integrated Platform

The goal of TIP is to build a digital resource that (a) stores and integrates data from the labs that are part of the SRP center in UCD and (b) enables access to that data for both internal and external partners through an application programming interface (API), a command line interface and later on a web interface.
